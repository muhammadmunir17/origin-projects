                        cashews,cocoa and shea nuts,we gradually refined our operational scope

                    <h4>Sustainability</h4>
                    <p>
                        In 2013, we invested over 19 billion Naira in a 10,000 hectare farm with integrated mill which directly 
                        employs 950 people from the surrounding communities, producing 36,000 metric tonnes of rice for the Nigerian
                        markets (<Em>Mama’s Pride and Mama’s Choice brands</Em>). The farm also supports an ‘outgrower programme’ whereby surrounding
                        rice-growing communities are supported by the Olam farm with training, pre-finance, fertiliser and 
                        seeds in order to improve their paddy yields.Currently 7,000 farmers  are engaged in the programme
                        .This investment is specifically in line with the Government’s Agricultural Transformation Agenda to produce 
                        rice for the domestic market thereby boosting self-sufficiency. In 2013, it was internationally recognised by 
                        The Rockefeller Foundation as a catalytic innovation’ in African Agriculture’ and in 2018, it has been identified as 
                        one of 3 high impact success stories for Global Recognition by the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
                        Investments in recent years, in addition to the rice farm, include:<br>
                    </p>
                    <ul id="long">
                        <li>Pioneering domestic sesame hulling and sesame exports. Olam was the first entrant into the Japanese import market in 1995, and has invested in state-of-the-art processing facilities in Lagos and Ogun states, which employ close to 1000 workers;</li><br>
                        <li>In 2017, we invested in an integrated animal feed mill, poultry breeding farms and hatchery in Chikpiri Gabas Village, Gwagwada in Kaduna State. Through our facilities, we are stimulating the entire Nigerian poultry and fish farming sector by providing local farmers and distributors with high-quality feed and chicks at competitive prices, offering training for farmers on best poultry practices and creating thousands of direct and indirect rural employment opportunities.</li>
